Common signs include waking up with red, itchy bites, often in straight lines or clusters. Look for reddish-brown stains on mattresses or bedding, which may result from crushed bugs or droppings. You might also notice tiny black spots, bed bug feces, or shed skins near mattress seams, box springs, or bed frames. Check these areas with a flashlight, as bed bugs hide in crevices and cracks.
