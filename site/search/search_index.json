Common signs include waking up with red, itchy bites, often in straight lines or clusters. Look for reddish-brown stains on mattresses or bedding, which may result from crushed bugs or droppings. You might also notice tiny black spots, bed bug feces, or shed skins near mattress seams, box springs, or bed frames. Check these areas with a flashlight, as bed bugs hide in crevices and cracks.

Bed bug sprays with pyrethrins or pyrethroids kill bed bugs instantly on visible surfaces. Bed bug insecticide dusts are ideal for hidden spaces like wall voids or furniture cracks, providing long-term results.
